A script to use nearlyfreespeech.net's feature of being able to redirect an
email alias to a URL in order to create new actions in a tracks installation.

This uses the REST API of a Tracks installation.  Even if it is not directly
useful as is, you might find it a useful reference of some PHP code that uses
the Tracks API.

See comments in the todo_mail_handler.php file for how to setup and configure.
